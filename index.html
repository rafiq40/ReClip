## Overview

ReClip ("the App") is a clipboard history manager for macOS developed by RafalTech. Your privacy is fundamental to how ReClip is built. The App is designed to operate entirely on your device with no data ever leaving your Mac.

## Data Collection

**ReClip does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.** Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No usage analytics or telemetry is gathered
- No crash reports are sent
- No advertising identifiers are used
- No cookies or tracking technologies are employed
- No user accounts or registration is required

## Data Storage

All clipboard history captured by ReClip is stored locally on your Mac using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data resides exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to any external server, cloud service, or third party.

Stored data may include:
- Text content you have copied to the clipboard
- Image thumbnails of copied images
- Metadata such as the source application name and timestamps

This data is stored within the App's sandboxed container and is only accessible to ReClip.

## Network Access

ReClip has **no network access whatsoever**. The App does not connect to the internet, does not make any HTTP requests, and does not communicate with any servers. There are no APIs, no cloud synchronization, and no remote services involved in the operation of the App.

## Third-Party Services

ReClip does not integrate with or use any third-party services, SDKs, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Privacy Exclusions

ReClip includes a built-in feature that allows you to exclude specific applications from clipboard monitoring. When an app is added to the exclusion list, ReClip will not capture any clipboard content originating from that application. This feature is designed to protect sensitive data from password managers, banking apps, and other security-sensitive software.

## Data Deletion

You can delete your clipboard history at any time from within the App using the "Clear History" function. Uninstalling ReClip will remove all stored clipboard data along with the App.

## Children's Privacy

ReClip does not knowingly collect any data from children or any other users. Since the App collects no data at all, it is safe for users of all ages.

## App Store Privacy Labels

In accordance with Apple's App Store requirements, ReClip declares **"Data Not Collected"** as its privacy nutrition label. No data types are collected or linked to user identity.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the revised version will be posted at the URL below with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since ReClip collects no data, material changes to this policy are unlikely.
